A simple parser combinators for OCaml.

I learned about parser combinators from Chapter 13 of 'Programming in Haskell', then referenced two papers also authored by Professor Graham Hutton
[Monadic parser combinators](http://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/pszgmh/bib.html#monparsing) and [Monadic parsing in Haskell](http://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/pszgmh/bib.html#pearl)

The CIS 1940 course slides also provided valuable insights [parser-combinator-class](https://github.com/ngernest/parser-combinator-class)

The code examples are adapted from the [wyas](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) tutorial and re-implemented in OCaml. There's a minor issue in the final step implementation, after some time has passed, I've forgotten some details. If I find time to revisit OCaml, I'll attempt to resolve it.
